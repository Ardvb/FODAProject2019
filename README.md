# Fundamentals of Data Analysis Project 2019: Exploring the 'Tips' Dataset


![tip-jar](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47186083/68902310-de244e00-072f-11ea-83c9-0205dbbaf18a.jpg)

In this repository you will find my work on the project for the module Fundamentals of Data Analysis at GMIT.
I have done research on the tips dataset and created a Juputer Notebook with my findings.
First I have described the dataset, then I have looked at the correlation between the total bill and the tip, and in the last section I have looked at the relationships between the other variables.

## Getting started

Follow these steps to download this repository:

- Go to my repository on Github: https://github.com/Ardvb/FODAProject2019
- Click the clone or download button.
- Save the repository to your device.
- To run the program open a command interface and navigate to the folder in which the repository was saved.
- The full 'tips' dataset can be downloaded here: https://www.kaggle.com/ranjeetjain3/seaborn-tips-dataset
## Jupyter Notebook

I used a Jupyter notebook to display my work.
The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more. https://jupyter.org/


## Running my Jupiter Notebook
- Install Jupyterla. This is part of the Anaconda package, that can be downloaded here: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
- Navigate to the folder where the repository has been downloaded on the command line.
- typ: Jupyter Notebook
- From the 'home' page, click on the file called 'FODA Assessment 2019.ipynb'
- For more information on how to use Jupyter Notebook go to the Help section in the toolbar on the top of your screen.

## Background information on the dataset
In one restaurant, a food server recorded the following data on all customers they served during an interval of two and a half months in early 1990. The restaurant, located in a suburban shopping mall, was part of a national chain and served a varied menu. In observance of local law, the restaurant offered to seat in a non-smoking section to patrons who requested it. Each record includes a day and time, and taken together, they show the serverâ€™s work schedule. 7 variables were recorded in this dataset: tip, total bill, sex, day, time, size and smoker.

## Quick overview of research

I will keep this part brief as all can be found nicely displayed in the jupyter notebook.


This project is divided in 3 parts:

### 1. Description

In this section I have explained all 7 variables. I have added plots and used descriptive statistics to describe the dataset in detail.
Variables used in this dataset:

total bill: the total bill 

### 2. Regression

#### - 2.1
In this section I explain the relationship between total bill and tip. I visualize this relationship using many different plot.
#### - 2.2 
Here I explain the (possible) relationship between total bill and tip percentage

### 3. Analysis
In this chapter I explain the possible relationships between many different sets of variables.
#### - 3.1
Plotted some pairplots to have a quick overview of some possibly interesting relationships
#### - 3.2 Correlation between time and (relative) tip size
#### - 3.3 Correlation between day of the week, time of day and (relative) tip size
#### - 3.4 Correlation between size and (relative) tip size
#### - 3.5 Correlation between sex, time, size, total bill and (relative) tip size
#### - 3.6 Correlation between smoking, total bill and (relative) tip size
#### - 3.7 Multiple variables combined: day, total bill, sex and tip
#### - 3.8 Multiple variables combined: Smoker, sex, time and size
#### - 3.9 Conclusions
A brief summary of my most interesting findings.


## Packages used

### - Numpy 
Numpy is a fundamental library for scientific computing in Python. It adds support for large, multi dimensional arrays and matrices. It also includes a large collection of high level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
### - Seaborn
Seaborn is a Python visualization library based on matplotlib, providing a high-level interface for drawing statistical graphics. I found this library to be easy to use and used it to plot swarmplots and scatterplots.
### - Matplotlib
Matplotlib is the plotting library of Numpy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications. I used this library to plot histograms, amongst other things.
### - Pandas
Pandas is a library providing high-performance, and easily usable data structures and data analysis tools for Python. It is built on top of Numpy, so that means Numpy is required by Pandas. I have used it to read in the excel file containing the Iris date set, amongst other things.
