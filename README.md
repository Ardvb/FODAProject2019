In this repository you will find my work on the project for the module Fundamentals of Data Analysis at GMIT.
I have done research on the tips dataset and tried to find interesting relations between the different variables.
First I have described the dataset, then I have looked at the correlation between the total bill and the tip, and in the last section I have looked at the relationships between the other variables.
